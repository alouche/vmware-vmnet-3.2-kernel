This is the vmnet linux kernel module as provided by Vmware. Vmware is the origianl owner and copyright owner of this module, however patches ported to it to make it compatible to the Linux kernel 3.2 are not officially supported by Vmware. Vmware may decide to incorporate the changes, however I provide absolutely no guarantee - I create these patches for my own usage, so use at your own risks :-)
